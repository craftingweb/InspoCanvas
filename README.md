Yesterday, I joined Vibe Hacks, a fast-paced hackathon focused on creating impactful products using AWS Bedrock. Unlike most hackathons, this one was incredibly short, under 4 hours, making it the shortest I’ve ever participated in. With limited time, I dove in to build something meaningful.

🧠 Inspiration
The idea came from thinking about artists who have great ideas but struggle to express them, especially those with language barriers or disabilities. I wanted to create a tool that makes creativity easier and more inclusive, even for those who don’t use traditional ways of communicating.

🚀 What I Built 🎨 InspoCanvas

InspoCanvas is a multimodal creative tool powered by AWS Bedrock. It lets users either type or speak prompts like: “a dreamscape in gold with birds flying through mist”. The app understands tone, mood, and visual detail, and turns that into a beautiful AI-generated moodboard or visual concept.

Key Features:

Text & Voice Input (including multilingual support)
AI-generated visuals that reflect the feeling behind the prompt
A Learning Corner to teach basics like color theory and composition

🧩 Built With:

AWS Bedrock
Claude
Next.js
Tailwind CSS
TypeScript

🎯 Why It Matters

InspoCanvas isn’t just a visual tool — it’s meant to give anyone the power to express their imagination. Whether someone has limited language skills or prefers speaking over typing, they can still create something beautiful.
